# Governance

Webpack is a tool that is used by the entire world. This meanas that in order to ensure stability, a set of collaborators is required to make sure the project is stable, secure and relevant. A governance model of webpack is therefore needed.

## Roles and Responsibilities

This section describes the various of types of roles within the webpack organization.

### Users

The users of webpack is the ones using it from npm, shares resources to webpack and advocates for the tool. These users could become more involved in the project over time, becoming maintainer(-s) of the project in roles such as Reviewer or Contributor.

### Contributors

Contributors are people that contribute to webpack. There are different methods of contributing, such as documentation work in different parts of webpack. Documentation contributions are an important part of the webpack organization - the documentation of webpack itself or 2nd hand documentation webpack contrib.

Another method of contributing to webpack is to participate in issue triaging, contributing code. There are no expectations of actively participating to webpack. Any person is welcome to contribute to webpack, regardless of skillsets or experience.

If a contributor has contributed to the organization for some time and shown progression, a contributor may become a maintainer of webpack.

## Documenter

This section describes the documentation work in both the official documentation (webpack.js.org), and documentation in each webpack repository.

A "Documenter" is a contributor that is working on documentation on the main webpack.js.org page and in the webpack repositories. This work is very important for the webpack project in order for users to be able to understand how to use webpack and its 2nd hand tools.

The work as a "Documenter" is done by understanding the API And codebase of webpack and webpack-contrib well enough to express how to use it as a user. To become a documenter:

- Play well with others and show good team synergy.
- Be able to communicate factual topics to a understandable format.
- Shown activity in webpack and/or webpack-contrib.

During Technical Steering Commitee meetings, the team will assign and/or discuss efforts in the webpack documentation. If a new contributor to the documentation (documenter) is involved in webpack/webpack contrib, the team will nominate this individual to the documentation team.

## Commiters

A commiter is an individual that has shown prolonged interested in the webpack project and has done continuous code contributions to the webpack organization. A commiter has write access to one or more repositories in the webpack organization.

A commiter may contribute to one or more repositories in the webpack organization. A commiter is expected to be active in the organization and participate in the organization's activities.

TBD (Better Wording, rights and responsibilities)

## Core Commiters

A core commiter is an individual that has a good understanding of the core of webpack and that has done continuous code contributionsd to the core of webpack. A core commiter performs all the duties and has all the rights of a commiter, but necessarily has access to the core of webpack.

TBD (Better Wording, rights and responsibilities)

## Triagers

A triager is an individual that has shown interest in the webpack project and has done continuous work in the issue tracker of the webpack organization. A triager is expected to be active in the organization and participate in the organization's activities.

Triagers may review and/or triage issues and pull requests and help maintain the issue tracker of the webpack organization.

TBD (Better Wording, rights and responsibilities)

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

A subset of the collaborators forms the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
The TSC has final authority over this project, including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of collaborators

The current list of TSC members is in [the project README][].

The [TSC Charter][] governs the operations of the TSC. All changes to the charter need approval by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council (CPC)](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/)

### TSC Meetings

Technical Steering Commitee meetings are hosted on Slack over text for about 20-30 minutes every month or 2nd week.

TBD (meeting times and interval)

### Consensus seeking process

The TSC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model per the [TSC Charter][].
