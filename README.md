# webpack Project Governance 

The webpack Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of webpack. It is described in the [TSC Charter](./TSC_CHARTER.md).

## TSC scope

The TSC is responsible for the webpack/webpack (webpack) project, the webpack GitHub organization, some projects dependent upon webpack/webpack, and several projects adjacent to webpack/webpack. Note that `webpack/webpack` refers to the webpack project.

The TSC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities and would like to agree with the OpenJS Foundation Board on any change to the scope of those responsibilities as defined below.

### List of TSC responsibilities

The TSC exercises autonomy in setting up and maintaining procedures, policies, and management and administrative structures as it deems appropriate for the maintenance and operation of these projects and resources.

Included in the responsibilities of the TSC are:

* Managing code and documentation creation and changes for the listed projects
  and resources
* Setting and maintaining standards covering contributions of code,
  documentation, and other materials
* Managing code and binary releases: types, schedules, frequency, delivery
  mechanisms
* Making decisions regarding dependencies of the webpack/webpack project,
  including what those dependencies are and how they are bundled with source
  code and releases
* Creating new repositories and projects under the webpack GitHub organization
  as required
* Setting overall technical direction for the webpack/webpack project, including
  high-level goals and low-level specifics regarding features and functionality
* Setting and maintaining appropriate standards for community discourse via the
  various mediums under TSC control
* Setting and maintaining governance rules for the conduct and make-up of the
  TSC, Working Groups and other bodies within the TSC's domain

Many of these responsibilities will be delegated by the TSC to appropriate bodies such as the Working Groups.

## TSC members

TSC members are responsible for top-level technical community concerns. Their role is mostly administrative. They are responsible for admitting new Working Groups and advocating for any needs in the technical side of the project to the OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors.

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend to be people who are competent in community management and have a high tolerance and patience for process minutiae, as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities to other working groups.

A [current list of TSC members](https://github.com/webpack/webpack#tsc-technical-steering-committee) is maintained in the `webpack/webpack` repository.

## Working Groups

The [WORKING_GROUPS.md] (./WORKING_GROUPS.md) file contains all documents related to Working Groups (WGs), how to form a WG, and its responsibilities.

## Expenses & OpenCollective

The webpack project funds and expenses are documented on the [OPEN_COLLECTIVE.md](./OPEN_COLLECTIVE.md) file.

## Policy change proposal process

The webpack TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Working Groups, Which have broad powers of self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes intended to cover all Working Groups, a PR should be opened against this repository (webpack/governance).

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups can refuse changes to their charters. The TSC can not mandate that existing working groups alter their charters, but if such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's charter.
