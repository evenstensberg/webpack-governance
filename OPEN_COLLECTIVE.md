# Open Collective

The webpack project runs an Open Collective to help fund the project. 

This collective supports the team that is developing webpack. The funds collected are intended to support dedicated staff, compensate those who are regularly contributing to webpack, and hire freelancers to help with needs we can't otherwise meet (:thinking_emoji:). Funding also allows us to send team members to conferences, companies, and meetups to meet with our users to discuss and solve the problems they are facing.

## Why we need funding

webpack is a complex project that is maintained by a group volunteers. It is a critical part of the JavaScript ecosystem and is used by millions of developers. The project has a large surface area and is constantly evolving. The Open Collective enables us to keep the project relevant and support the volunteers who are working on it.

## How we use the funds

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) reserves the right to allocate funds as they see fit. The funds are used to support the project and the people who work on it. This includes:

- Paying for the infrastructure that the project needs
- Paying for the services that the project needs
- Paying for long-standing open source contributions done by its volunteers
- Paying for attendance to summits or conferences that require attendance of project members
  - For example, the [Google Summer of Code][] mentor summit.
- Paying mentors for their time spent mentoring students during the [Google Summer of Code][] program.
  - Note that this is a fixed stipend defined by Google. Based on previous editions, it is expected to be around $500 per student mentored.

### Eligibility for requesting funds

- You must be a long (and good) standing contributor to the project
- Your work must be significant and have a positive impact on the project
- The funds are calculated based on the work done and the impact it has on the project (issues, pull requests, etc.)
  - The amount of funds granted are at the discretion of the TSC and may use a predefined set of rules/criterias to calculate disbursion of funds.
  - The funds are not guaranteed and are subject to the availability of funds in the collective, in a manner that is sustainable for the project.
  - Contributors that are granted funds may only request expensing once per month. These requests are not guaranteed to be approved and are subject to the availability of funds in the collective and priorisiation of contributions.
